Autumn's tapestry, a spectrum of falling leaves,\nReds, yellows, and golds intermixing to believe.\nCrisp air and sweater weather, the harvest festives,\nApples and pumpkins, a time for cosy nestles.\nWinds whisper tales of summer past, as the days grow fast.\nChildren laugh in piles of leaves, a joyful blast,\nAutumn brings a pause, a reflective space,\nWhere the earth slows down, and nature embraces the grace.\nThe sun sinks earlier, and the moon rises sweet,\nAs autumn showers us with beauty, in its orange street.\nAs leaves turn and fall, a canvas of change,\nAutumn sings a song of wisdom, a season's exchange.
