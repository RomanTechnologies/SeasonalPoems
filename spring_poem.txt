The buds burst into color,
As spring arrives with its gentle breeze,
The birds sing with jubilant ewe,
Flowers bloom, the grass green and fresh,
A time of renewal, a restart, a fresh breath,
The earth awakens from its winterly death.
The sky grows bluer, and the sun shines bright,
As nature rejoices, with every flower and leaf in sight.
The air fills with fragrance, fresh and sweet,
It's a time of pleasure, a time to savor, a wonderful treat.
As we welcome spring, with each new day, a new hope, a new feat.
