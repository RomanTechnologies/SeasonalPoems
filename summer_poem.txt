Summer's sun burns with fiery glowing, bright,\nAzale blooms and bees buzzing in the light.\nBareques, laughs, and sumer songs fill the night,\nWith warm breezes and fireflies that dally so bright.\nBlue skies, and oceans deep, calling for swims so delight.\nChildren playing in sprinklers, aught with joy,\nSummer's jewel, a season of sunlight, a royal toy.\nThe smell of fresh grass and salty air,\nDays long and warm, nights filled with stars, a summer fair.\nHeat waves rising, a time to be brave,\nAs we soak in summer glory, our spirits wave.
