Winter's chill, a time of white, and snining cold,\nFrosts sparkle, as crystals fold, in nights so bold.\nFiresides warm, with hot cocoa and a story told,\nWhile children build snowmen, and snowballs roll.\nThe sky grows grey, as northern lights begin to shower,\nA wonderful display, a magnificent shower, folding in power.\nWinter whispers of ancient tales, as the earth gets slower,\nThe air fills with silence, and the snow covers it so lower.\nCarols sing, and lights glow,\nWinter's magic, a time of wonder, brings joy and gusto.\nAs the year closes, a season of rest,\nWinter, a gethering, a time for reflection, an echo of the past.
