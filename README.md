A poem about README files,Because they are like a grand tale to read,
A mirror of the project's soul, one might say,
Revealing its purpose, its aim, and the developer's way.

README, the book of the code,
A tale of where it began, and where it walks,
Laying out its journey, its hopes, and its tasks,
The narrative of the project, as it marks.

Within its lines, you'll find hints,
Clues, and insights of the creator's minds,
Traces of their struggles, their joys, their times,
READMES, they are more than just text.

As you peruse, discover, learn,
Amass knowledge that you can earn,
ReADSEs are not just a guide, but a friend in disguise,
Helping you navigate through the code, as you arise.
